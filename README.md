# python_challenge
This is my python challenge solution. Each bit of code should be commented enough to be made sense of by itself
One thing I want to note is that I did the coding in Jupyter before saving to .py files, so that is why there is some extra formatting in the python files. I did rerun everything
in the Python files on vscode to make sure it worked, and it did. My results were very consistent when I ran the code.
Also I struggled to push to git from git bash, and ended up just uploading the files manually

Also, I did look up and utilize code from stack overflow to open a csv to a list, specifically this code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24662571/python-import-csv-to-list
